# Day 1 

## James

1. setwd(), read.csv(): gap minder (donâ€™t assign)
2. assign simple objects as example
3. using ? (help) in R
4. Assign gapminder dataset. Useful data frame commands: head(), dim(), class(), str()
5. Indexing data frames - examples
6. Simple functions: min, max, mean, sd
7. Subsetting: apply()
8. Writing data: write.csv() on max/mean of gap minder variable
9. Plotting: raw data + functions (max, mins?) of data

## Evan
Here's a rough outline of my lesson:

1. basic plotting, adding color, adding lines,
2. adding keys, changing size and orientation of text
3. creating multi-plots with par
4. writing your own functions
5. using your function on your data with the apply functions
6. maybe write and use a function that reads a data frame, does a couple standard stats operations (stdev, min, max, for example) and makes a multi plot showing these for each sample/column/what have you in a comparative framework. that way the plotting and function lessons are tied together into some kind of coherent narrative
7. handoff to andrew

Do we think that's too much? I could do away with adding keys, changing text orientation, or using multiple layout plots, but I feel like the students should be able to handle this stuff. They're built in functions after all.

How about a function that takes three arguments - dataset name, x variable and y variable. Then does just one thing - either draws a plot OR does a linear model an extracts the slope, whatever.

Here is a function that makes a plot from the gapminder data. TO BE CONVERTED TO A SCRIPT THAT TAKES INPUTS:

gapminder_plot_fun<-function(gapminder, outformat=c("PDF", "SVG", "PNG")) {
	means<-aggregate(cbind(lifeExp, pop) ~ country + continent, gapminder, mean)
	mean_pop<-aggregate(pop ~ country + continent, gapminder, mean)
	
	maintitle<-c("Avg. Life Expectancies vs. Population in Different Countries")
	myylab<-c("average life expectancy") 
	myxlab<-c("average population")
	
#this if/ifelse/else statement will determine which output format is used
	if (outformat == "PDF") { #if statements determine what the plot output format will be
		pdf("gapminder_pop_vs_life_expectancy.pdf")
	}
	else if (outformat == "PNG") {
		png("gapminder_pop_vs_life_expectancy.png")
	}
	else (outformat == "SVG") {
		svg("gapminder_pop_vs_life_expectancy.svg")
	}
	plot(log(means$pop), means$lifeExp, main=maintitle, pch=20)
	text(log(means$pop), means$lifeExp, labels=means[,1], col=as.numeric(means$continent))
	dev.off()
}
